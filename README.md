Hi Sheshi!

Because you are using Angular, I decided to implement the code in Angular even though I am still learning how best to use it.

I could have used a JQuery Datatable, but wanted to implement the results in a Mat-Table since that seemed like a better approach in Angular.

This ended up taking me longer than expected and I ran into some issues with Pagination with the Mat-Table.  

I really enjoyed this exercise and have a new found excitement to get better at Angular development.  

I am sorry I did not hit all of the requirements with the exercise, I truly appreciate the opportunity.


##Overview
Use Case:
CareScout would like to create an application which can aggregate provider data from multiple data sources.
This application will be querying external and internal data sources to provide relevant search details.
Candidate is expected to use one such data source and query it real-time using the below provided data source: 
https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Provider-Info/4pq5-n9py
Business Rules:
1.	User should be able to search by one or more terms.
2.	Search form should include option to search by: 
o	Provider Number
o	Provider Name
o	Zip Code
3.	Results should be Wildcard search to one or more details provided by the user.
4.	Results should be paginated and sortable.
5.	Results page should include following details for each provider:
o	Provider Name
o	Provider Number
o	Provider Address (complete)
o	Phone Number
Expected Outcome:
1.	Provider search application, which will query the dataset in real-time to provide results.
2.	Results page can be bookmarked to be accessed later. Results should refresh every time it is accessed.
